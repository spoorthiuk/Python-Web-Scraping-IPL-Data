# Python-Web-Scraping-IPL-Data

Web Scraping is the process of extracting huge amount of data from the internet by automating the process through code. I have used Selinium to interact wwith the Google Chrome browser and to extract the required information. I have used python language to extract Indian Premier League (IPL) data. IPL is a very popular cricket tournament which has huge fan following in India as well as in the world. Players from all around the world take part in this tournament

The following details were extract from www.cricbuzz.com using Web Scraping
* Team 1
* Team 2
* Date 
* Year the match was played
* Time
* Place where the match took place
* Team the won the toss
* Decision made by the toss winning team
* Result of the match

Useful insights can be inferred from this data. It can be used in data analysis or a machine learning model can be built upon it to predict the outcome of the future matches.
